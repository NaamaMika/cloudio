# cloudio
cloudio simulates cloud for saving photos.
In the current project, the cloud collapsed and the goal was to restore the photos of the company's customers.
This project was divided into two parts: in the first part, the goal was to achieve the photos of one of the costumers
while researching the server that had fallen and download them.
The second part of the project required writing a script in Python that automatically performs what we did in the first part(achieve the photos of one of the costumers and download them from the fallen server.) This time on more than one customer.
